## What's Option?

Option is a governance product that makes it only profitable for companies to do good, and a tool for communities to choose for themselves what counts as good.

## Why use Option?

#### For consumers:
1. It's easy to express personal values in a way that will change companies' behavior
2. It's easy to choose products that are aligned with personal values and beliefs

#### For companies and entrepreneurs:
1. It's easy to be socially responsible while still purely pursing profit
2. It's easy to earn revenue for social goods that would otherwise require grants to support

#### For journalists and researchers:
1. It's easy to be a high integrity researcher or journalist
2. It's easy to find funding for exploring the most important open questions

#### For citizens:
1. It's easy to influence policy in an area of interest
2. It's easy to ignore politics without bad things happening

#### For communities:
1. It's easy to find and form communities of shared values
2. It's easy to make collective choices

## How does Option work?

### Prediction Markets for Policy Setting
The key idea behind Option is a prediction market where it's free to be accurate and expensive to be wrong. The predictions that players make are encoded directly into Option's native currency, making it risky to accept dubious predictions at face value, and therefore risky to make dubious predictions as others may not want to accept them as part of a payment.

Option can combine those predictions in order to automatically set policy for communities.

For example, in 2013 New York City proposed a ban on sugary drinks larger than 16 fluid ounces. The argument by the Board of Health was that the limit would improve public health and make it easier for people to reduce their caloric intake. The argument against this ban was that it would be legal overreach, and it violated the personal autonomy of consumers.

Had New York City citizens been able to opt into governance using Option, those who wanted to avoid unhealthy drinks would have experienced an increased price for the drinks (akin to a tax) dissuading them from purchasing. In exchange for this tax, Option's prediction that avoiding sugary drinks improves health outcomes would lower the effective healthcare costs of those that opted in to the tax.

As a second order effect of this system, soft drink providers like PepsiCo or CocaCola would find aggregate demand drop for the goods predicted to be unhealthy, incenting them to reduce the health implications of their products.

In this way, Option maintains individual autonomy while localizing individual responsibility; using markets and preferences instead of legislative bodies.

### Externalities

But, what about situations where members of a community are harmed by the actions of a company that they don't buy from?

For example, what if a mining operation leaches toxins into a nearby river, which harms a biodiverse ecosystem and degrades the health of locals? If those locals don't purchase products made from the mined minerals they cannot exert influence by boycotting the goods, so it would seem they don’t have market-based ability to minimize the pollution.

Those familiar with economics will recognize that this is a classic example of a *negative externality*, a bad thing that doesn't have an immediate cost associated with it. In this case, the locals and the ecosystem are harmed but the mining operation doesn't pay for that, so they enjoy artificially high profits. In other words, the mining company has socialized costs while privatizing gains.

### The Shortcomings of Regulation

One option to solve this problem is regulation. For example, the local government could say, "No more than 0.010 parts per million of arsenic in the water, otherwise we'll fine you 1 million dollars."

However, regulation has some well known problems:
1. Regulation is often slow to respond — markets outpace and outthink the regulators
2. Regulation is often imprecise — it over or under regulates, stifling innovation or permitting great harm
3. Regulation is often non-dynamic — it doesn't update with new knowledge
4. Regulators can become "captured" — the entities they should regulate find ways to influence the decision in their favor

### Coasian Bargaining
The field of economics offers a clever alternative to regulation called,  "Coasian Bargaining". The idea is named after Ronald Coase who won the Nobel Prize in Economics for this and related ideas. 
What would Coase recommend to these people whose river is being polluted? He would tell them to pay the mining operation to pollute less. The mining operation could agree to implement policies to reduce their pollution in exchange for the community paying them to offset the costs of implementing the policies. 

However, we can see some obvious issues with this idea:
1. How can the community know how much it actually costs to reduce pollution?
2. How will the community verify that the company is implementing the policies effectively?
3. How do future generations pay for the benefit of a healthy ecosystem and community?

For example, what if the community is willing to pay 2 million dollars to reduce pollution 50%, but:
1. The mining company says, "It costs us 5 million dollars to reduce pollution by 50%" when it really only costs them $2 million.
2. It costs 2 million dollars a year to run the water quality tests which confirm the company is complying.
3. Future generations, when asked, say that looking back they would have been willing to pay $50 million for a healthy community and ecosystem, not just $2 million.

Now you can see why Coasian Bargaining is of limited application, it only works where:
1. There's no hidden information about costs.
2. It's easy and cheap to validate performance.
3. The people who are affected are able to pay.

### Option's Coasian Bargaining

How does Option get around this? Option allows the local community to put negative valued money into the digital wallet of the mining operation. This forces the mining company to engage with the community. In exchange for this ability, the local community makes predictions (which they stake) that the mining operation can dispute. For example, they might say:
1. “It only costs 1 million dollars to reduce pollution by 50%”
2. “Every year, the mining company leaches 500,000 liters of pollution into the river”
3. “Future generations, when asked, will be willing to pay $100 million for the healthier community and ecosystem they enjoy thanks to the reduction in pollution”

Based on the expected future cost predicted by the local community, Option places a certain amount of negative money into the account of the mining operation.

But what happens if the local community overestimated the size of the future cost? In that case, the mining company can respond with their own predictions, making lower predictions (which they also stake) about the costs of their behavior. For example:
1. “It costs us 3 million dollars to reduce pollution by 50%”
2. “Every year, we only leach 100,000 liters of pollution into the river”
3. “Future generations, when asked, will be willing to pay $10 million for the healthier community and ecosystem they enjoy thanks to the reduction in pollution”

By taking this action, the mining company reduces the amount of negative money Option places in their account. However, this isn't the end of the story. Now all the money that was bet by the mining company and the local community come into play. That money becomes a bounty which can be paid to researchers and journalists for helping to refine the accuracy of the predictions.

### Disverifier Selection

How do these journalists, and researchers get selected and paid? That's the question this grant will fund.

The funds earned from this grant will go toward exploring the exact mechanism for how to select informed, unbiased, and sincere researchers and journalists (or "disverifiers" in Option's parlance). There are three reasons to think this is a tractable problem:
1. Option offers a natural way to identify bias — a measure of ideological “distance”. 
2. Sincerity and accuracy can be well incented by staking mechanisms.
3. The authors have identified a plausible mechanism for incenting precise and resolvable predictions.

Furthermore, it's possible this work is worth funding even if optimal disverifier selection proves impossible. It may be possible that the worst case performance of Option is still marginally better than some existing governance process. For example, we might imagine that Option fails to live up to the standards of the real-world legal system, but offers efficiencies for use in:
1. Governance of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
2. Open science modeling, e.g. in regenerative agriculture
3. Governance of content moderation on platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter or their web3 alternatives
4. Replacing bespoke web3 incentive models with API calls to Option, e.g. Sybil resistance for Gitcoin, or decentralized Yelp where each reviewer makes the claim, "This review was left by a real customer who was not paid."
5. Bug bounty and open source software funding via predictions like, “This project has no vulnerabilities.” Which simultaneously offers information about the confidence of the developers, while providing bounties for red teaming.


## Use of Funds
This grant will fund three primary activities performed by the [Decision Science and Control (DeSCon)](http://cs.uccs.edu/~pbrown2/lab.html) lab of [Dr. Philip Brown](http://cs.uccs.edu/~pbrown2/) or affiliates:
1. Prove game theoretic properties about the model (or simplified versions)
2. Implement the model in-silico and characterize its behaviors
3. (Stretch Goal) Implement Option as an interactive game

### Questions worth exploring:
- What's the Byzantine Fault Tolerance of the inference model?
- Can we characterize capacity for information aggregation?
- How do wealth effects (e.g. high income inequality) affect system behavior? 
- How quickly can a poorly funded accurate predictor overcome a well funded inaccurate incumbent?
- Can Option be framed as a version of a known game for easier analysis, e.g. Beauty Contests?
- What happens if we allow pricing of positive externalities? Does that introduce risks of collusion?
- In what ways might this be exploited to leak private information (e.g. values and beliefs or transaction history)? Can modifications avoid that?
- Can cognitive biases distort the game theoretic prediction, e.g. paying someone in a dubious claim induces sunk cost bias and doubling down.
- What are the expected psychosocial externalities of using Option? Cf. Twitter and Facebook’s tendency to incite outrage. Look at personas like: intrustors, citizens, disverifiers, 
- Given that Option creates funding as a function of disagreement, does this create a meta incentive for disverifiers to stoke disagreement? How does the magnitude of this incentive compare with the existing disagreement incentive of a two-party system?

This is an incredibly high level overview of Option and its purpose. If you would like to learn more about the details of the mechanisms that underpin Option, here are some good places to start:
* [Claim Market Prototype](https://coda.io/@connor/claim-market-prototype) This is a toy implementation of the Claim Market, the token layer of Option. It tells a story which helps to capture how Option prevents bribery and funds independent research. It’s implemented in Coda, so you can copy the doc and see all the underlying formulas.
* [Semantic Market Deck](example.com) This deck overviews the mechanisms of the Semantic Market, the adjudication layer of Option. It shows how economically weak players can still win against wealthy players, and how policy relevance can be game theoretically built up by recursively making, “I could be wrong if” statements.  

## Adoption Plausibility
Finally, it's worth addressing the most common objection to Option: if Option makes it more expensive to purchase goods *and* less profitable to sell goods, how will it ever get adopted?

There are two good answers to this.

First, we can expect that certain companies and people will benefit from Option beyond the price they pay. These will be the early adopters. 
For example, a company that practices ethical farming might accept Option's currency and stake predictions on Option in order to differentiate themselves from competitors that only purport to practice ethical farming. 
Similarly, certain consumers may have a strong preference for transacting in Option's currency because it allows them a credible signal of their values, it passively modifies the incentive landscape to better support their values, and they can sleep soundly in the knowledge that their economic behavior is non-detrimental.

Second, if Option is a better system of governance it will tend to outcompete other governance systems. Option is only expensive where there are expected future externalities to avoid. In the long run, we should expect communities, nations, and planets that more effectively evade negative externalities to outcompete those that don't.
